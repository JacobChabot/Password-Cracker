This Python program involves cracking hashes of passwords using two different files: hashed_password.txt and salted_passwords.txt. The user will be asked which file they wish to
crack, and the program will call the appropriate function. The function will generate a random password, hash it, then check if it matches with any the hashedpasswords in the files. 
Both functions are the same except the salted_passwords function will utilize the salt included in the salted_passwords file.
